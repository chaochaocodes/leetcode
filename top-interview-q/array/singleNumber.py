# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# Follow up: Could you implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory?

# Time complexity : O(n \cdot 1) = O(n)O(nâ‹…1)=O(n). Time complexity of for loop is O(n)O(n). Time complexity of hash table(dictionary in python) operation pop is O(1)O(1).

# Space complexity : O(n)O(n). The space required by hash\_tablehash_table is equal to the number of elements in \text{nums}nums.


# Leetcode Approach #3: Math
def singleNumber(nums):

    return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)

# Time complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). sum will call next to iterate through \text{nums}nums. We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in nums)) which means the time complexity is O(n)O(n) because of the number of elements(nn) in \text{nums}nums.

# Space complexity : O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n). set needs space for the elements in nums
