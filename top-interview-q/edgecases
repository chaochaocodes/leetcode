Edge cases to consider:

String with some known special cases:

    Empty, null string
    Long string
    Unicode string (special characters)
    If limited to a specific set of characters, what happens when some are not in the range
    Odd/even length string
    Null (as argument)
    Non-null terminated

Integer with known special cases:

    0
    Min/MaxInt
    Negative/Positive

Sort algorithm that could fail in the following boundary cases:

    Empty input
    1 element input
    Very long input (maybe of length max(data type used for index))
    Garbage inside the collection that will be sorted
    Null input
    Duplicate elements
    Collection with all elements equal
    Odd/even length input
    Then, take all these cases and create a long list trying to understand how they overlap. Ex:

Empty string case covers the empty collection case
Null string == null collection
etc.
